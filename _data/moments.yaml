  title: Our First Date
  content: >-
    Our first date was at Howells and Hood. I met Rui outside the Tribune 
    Tower after work. We talked over a beer and some pretzel bytes. Well... I 
    talked a lot, and too fast.

    This time we went to a movie, _Incredibles 2_. The short before the movie 
    was _Bao_. I think we both liked the short better than the movie. _-Ian_

  title: Dinosaurs and Fireworks

    A lot happened this Independence Day. We started by meeting at OTC and heading
    to the Field Museum. I learned how much you love nature. And I got to introduce
    you to the wonder of "Mold-a-rama"ðŸ˜†, a little slice of my youth. Then we 
    headed for Millennium Part to see the Grant Park orchestra play. Afterwords,
    we headed to Navy Pier to see the fireworks. We got as close as we could and
    found some grass to sit on. The best part for me was having you in my arms.
    A storm rolled in shortly after the fireworks ended. We got drenched! _-Ian_
